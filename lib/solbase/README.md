## Safety

This is **experimental software** and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

While each [major release has been audited](audits), these contracts are **not designed with user safety** in mind:

- There are implicit invariants these contracts expect to hold.
- **You can easily shoot yourself in the foot if you're not careful.**
- You should thoroughly read each contract you plan to use top to bottom.

We **do not give any warranties** and **will not be liable for any loss** incurred through any use of this codebase.
